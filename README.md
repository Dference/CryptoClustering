# CryptoClustering


## Shoooooow me the moneeeey
In this challenge, I used knowledge of Python and unsupervised learning to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes. To begin, I normalized the data from the CSV file, then proceeded to find the best value for K and cluster the cryptocurrencies for examination. Following that, I used Principle Component Analysis to optimize the clusters, then used the PCA data to continue to cluster the cryptocurrencies and extract data to lead to a conclusion about the affect of 24-hour or 7-day price changes.
